# Newzeed
An online news app which displays the most recent news from different domains like science, tech, sports, health and entertainment and also the common affairs of the world (non specific news), the data is retrieved from the web server with the help of a news api (a rest api).

It uses retrofit as the rest client and the unique api key is generated from newsapi.org.
The app uses different fragments to represent different domains of news, thus multiple classes have been used.
POJO/Model classes have been created with the help of online JSON to java converter.
Moreover the app gives the date and time when the news was circulated along with its author.
